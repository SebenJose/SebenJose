# Hi! I'm José Seben 👋

I'm a computer science student passionate about game development. 🧠🎮  
I love bringing my ideas to life — turning something from my imagination into a real and interactive experience.  
In addition to game development, I'm currently exploring and improving my skills in front-end development as well.
